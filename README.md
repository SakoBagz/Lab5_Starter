Question 1: I would not rely on a unit test to test the "messaging" feature of a messaging application. This is because there are a lot of moving parts and it would be difficult to overlook the workflow that occurs with the components of messaging. There would be no way to confidently know that messages actually transfer from user to user.  \
Question 2: I would implement unit testing for this situation. Unit tests in this case would give good quick feedback and cover edge cases. Could check length with strings of 79, 80, and 81 and make an assertion. \
